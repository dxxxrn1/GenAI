Selected Function
Data Validation Function with Nested Conditionals (JavaScript)

Problems Identified Before Refactoring
Too many responsibilities - The function handled 8+ major validation domains, all in a single long block.
 nested conditionals - Many if / else / else if layers made it hard to follow.

Mixed abstraction levels - High-level rules (“validate registration fields”) mixed with low-level logic (regex patterns, date math).

Hard to test - Because everything lived in one place, isolating bugs or writing unit tests for specific behaviors was difficult.

breaking down the ValidateUserData function improved its readability by breaking down key responsibilties into seperate functions 
ensuring each focuses on one task at a time maing each part easier to understand such as validateUsername,ValidatePassword,etc...
instead of reading through all nested conditions we have better blocks of code to understand with clear functions

Maintainability
When validation rules need to change such as password requirements, we can change a single function without affecting other fucntions in other validation logic 
Each function can now be better tested independently then trying to validate and test edge cases on one large code of nested Conditionals 
The functions can also be now reused for other validations so code is not repeated 


Challenging part of decomposing the function?
Was identifying key logic to use as all functions were mixed and some overlapped such as email rules working for both registation and updates
Making sure extraction didnt break functionlaity without losing the reqired parameters

invalid dates
age < 13
age > 120
future dates 

extracted function would be most reusable in other contexts?
validateEmail(userData, options)
Email format validation is common across apps
Uniqueness check can be injected (via options.checkExisting)
Works for both registration and profile updates
Self-contained logic with clear inputs and output
