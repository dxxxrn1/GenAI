1.Error description
the error message was IndexError: list index out of range which occured becuase we 
tried to access a list element that is outside the valid range of the list 
resulting in the loop running over it then giving an error 

2.Root cuase
The loop used range(len(items) + 1) 
instead of range(len(items)).
Python lists are zero-based. For a list of length n, valid indices are 0 to n-1.
Chain of events:

main() creates a list of 3 items.

print_inventory_report(items) is called.

The loop computes range(len(items) + 1) → 0,1,2,3.

Accessing items[3] triggers the IndexError.

3. Suggested Solution
Minimal fix:

Remove the +1 in the loop:

for i in range(len(items)):
    print(f"Item {i+1}: {items[i]['name']} - Quantity: {items[i]['quantity']}")

    
4. Learning Points

A.Off-by-one errors are common in loops using indices. Always double-check range(len(list)) versus range(len(list) + 1).

B.Prefer enumerate() over manual indexing — cleaner, safer, and less error-prone.

C.Validate data inputs: ensure lists are the expected type and contain expected keys.

D.Write unit tests for edge cases: empty lists, lists with missing keys, single-element lists.

E.Understand Python list boundaries: 0-based indexing is fundamental; len(list) is always out-of-bounds for direct access.
