📘 Task Manager – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Overview

This FAQ is designed to help developers using the Task Manager CLI application resolve common questions around:

Installation and dependencies

Running commands

Managing tasks

Troubleshooting

Advanced usage

The focus is on terminal-based workflows, as the tool is primarily CLI driven.

1. 🚀 Getting Started
❓ What is this Task Manager?

The Task Manager is a command-line tool that allows users to:

Add and remove tasks

Mark tasks as completed

Organize tasks by status or priority

Track overdue tasks and view statistics

It stores data locally in a JSON file.

❓ What are the prerequisites?

You need:

Python 3.8 or newer

pip installed

Terminal access

A code editor (optional but recommended)

❓ How do I install the project?

Clone the repository and install requirements:

git clone <repo-url>
cd task-manager
pip install -r requirements.txt


If you don’t have a requirements file, you may only need built-in libraries.

❓ How do I run the application?

From the project root:

python cli.py


If that doesn’t work, try:

python3 cli.py

2. 🧰 Features & Functionality
❓ How do I add a task?

Use the create command:

python cli.py add "Task title" --description "Optional text" --priority 1 --due 2025-01-01 --tags work


Priority values:

1: High

2: Medium

3: Low

❓ How do I list tasks?

List all tasks:

python cli.py list


Filter by status:

python cli.py list --status done


Filter by priority:

python cli.py list --priority 1


Show only overdue tasks:

python cli.py list --overdue

❓ How do I mark a task as done?
python cli.py done <task_id>


You can find the task ID from the list command.

❓ How do I update a task?

Update priority:

python cli.py update-priority <task_id> 1


Update due date:

python cli.py update-due <task_id> 2025-01-01

❓ How do I delete a task?
python cli.py delete <task_id>

❓ Can I tag a task?

Add a tag:

python cli.py tag-add <task_id> urgent


Remove a tag:

python cli.py tag-remove <task_id> urgent

❓ Can I view task statistics?
python cli.py stats

3. 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues
❓ The program says "Invalid date format"

Due dates must use YYYY-MM-DD:

✔ Correct:

2025-03-10


✘ Wrong:

10/03/2025
2025.03.10
2025/3/10

❓ The program cannot find a task with the given ID

Possible causes:

Wrong ID (check spelling)

Task was deleted

Storage file corrupted

Try listing tasks:

python cli.py list

❓ I get "ModuleNotFoundError: models"

You are likely running from the wrong directory.

Make sure you're in the root folder:

cd task-manager
python cli.py

❓ My tasks disappeared after an error

The JSON file may be corrupted.

Try:

Rename tasks.json to tasks_backup.json

Restart the app

❓ The CLI doesn’t recognize the command

Common mistakes:

Using hyphens instead of underscores

Missing positional arguments

Using Python instead of Python3

Check help:

python cli.py --help

4. 🧪 Specific Area: Advanced Usage
❓ How do I filter tasks by both status and priority?

Currently, the CLI supports one filter at a time.
You can combine filters manually using shell tools:

Example:

python cli.py list --status done | grep high

❓ Can I store tasks somewhere other than tasks.json?

Yes – pass a storage path when creating the TaskManager instance:

tm = TaskManager(storage_path="my_tasks.json")


CLI support may be added later.

❓ Can multiple users share the same tasks file?

Not currently recommended.

The JSON file is not concurrency-safe.

❓ Can I integrate this into another Python app?

Yes, import the classes:

from task_manager import TaskManager
tm = TaskManager()


You can:

Create tasks

Modify tasks

Query tasks

Build new interfaces

5. 🛠 Known Issues

6. 🆘 Help & Support
❓ Where are tasks stored?

Default:

tasks.json


Located in the project root.

❓ How do I reset everything?
